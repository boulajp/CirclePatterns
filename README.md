## Let's make cool pictures!

CirclePatterns is a generator of spirographic art.

I wrote this after watching a gif of something similar.  
Developed with .NET in Visual Studio

As they should be, most properties of the spirograph are variable.
  >1. Size difference between circles
  >2. Speed difference between circles
  >3. Number of circles

## Sample
Here is a sample of three resulting images from running the program:
